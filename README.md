# professional-readme-generator

This homework is for making a readme.md file generator using node.js

Files inslude:
*javascript x2
*json x2
*gitignore x1
*node_modules
*readme x2 

I started this project by working on the array of questions that would be asked to the user based on the criteria for the assignment. Once I completed the array I realized I needed to include some of the const for require. After I completed that I made a function to take the input from the user and append the information to a readme file that would be created. Once I successfully created the readme file with all of the user input, I worked on making sure that the readme had a better style and structure using a markdown template in js and linking it to the initial js file. Finally I scanned through my work for any bugs and minor fixes that were needed based on the code I ended up writing.
